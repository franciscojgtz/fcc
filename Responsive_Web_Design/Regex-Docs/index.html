            <header><h2>What are Regular Expressions</h2></header>
            <p>Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular 
                expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the <code>exec</code> and <code>test</code> methods of <code>RegExp</code>, and with the 
                <code>match</code>, <code>replace</code>, <code>search</code>, and <code>split</code> methods of <code>String</code>. 
                This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Creating_a_Regular_Expression">
            <header><h2>Creating a Regular Expression</h2></header>
            <p>You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:</p>
            <p>Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows:</p>
            <p><code>var re = /ab+c/;</code></p>
            <p>Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. 
                If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.</p>
            <p>Or calling the constructor function of the <code>RegExp</code> object, as follows:</p>
            <p><code>var re = new RegExp('ab+c');</code></p>
            <p>Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor 
                function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the pattern and are 
                getting it from another source, such as user input.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Writing_a_Regular_Expression_Pattern">
            <header><h2>Writing a Regular Expression Pattern</h2></header>
            <p>A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as <code>/abc/</code>, or a combination of simple and 
                special characters, such as <code>/ab*c/</code> or <code>/Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/</code>. The last example includes parentheses which are used as a 
                memory device. The match made with this part of the pattern is remembered for later use, as described in 
                <a href="#Using_Parenthesized_substring_matches">Using parenthesized substring matches.</a></p>
                <h3 id="Using_Simple_Patterns"> Using simple patterns</h3>
                <p>Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to find a direct match. For example, the pattern <code>/abc/</code> matches character
                     combinations in strings only when exactly the characters 'abc' occur together and in that order. Such a match would succeed in the 
                     strings "Hi, do you know your abc's?" and "The latest airplane designs evolved from slabcraft." In both cases the match is with the 
                     substring 'abc'. There is no match in the string 'Grab crab' because while it contains the substring 'ab c', it does not contain the 
                     exact substring 'abc'.</p>
                <h3 id="Using_Special_Characters">Using special characters</h3>
                <p>
                    When the search for a match requires something more than a direct match, such as finding one or more b's, or finding white space, 
                    the pattern includes special characters. For example, the pattern <code>/ab*c/</code> matches any character combination in which a single 
                    'a' is followed by zero or more 'b's <code>(*</code> means 0 or more occurrences of the preceding item) and then immediately followed by 'c'. 
                    In the string "cbbabbbbcdebc," the pattern matches the substring 'abbbbc'.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    Escaping user input that is to be treated as a literal string within a regular expression—that would otherwise be 
                    mistaken for a special character—can be accomplished by simple replacement:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     <pre>
                         <code>
function escapeRegExp(string) {
    return string.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&'); // $& means the whole matched string
}
                         </code>
                     </pre>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    The g after the regular expression is an option or flag that performs a global search, looking in the whole string and returning 
                    all matches. It is explained in detail below in 
                    <a href="Advanced_Searching_With_Flags">Advanced Searching With Flags</a>.
                 </p>
                 <h3 id="Using_Parentheses">Using Parentheses</h3>   
                 <p>
                    Parentheses around any part of the regular expression pattern causes that part of the matched substring to be remembered. 
                    Once remembered, the substring can be recalled for other use, as described in 
                    <a href="#Using_Parenthesized_Substring_Matches">Using Parenthesized Substring Matches</a>.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    For example, the pattern <code>/Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/</code> illustrates additional escaped and special characters and indicates that part 
                    of the pattern should be remembered. It matches precisely the characters 'Chapter ' followed by one or more numeric characters 
                    (<code>\d</code> means any numeric character and <code>+</code> means 1 or more times), followed by a decimal point (which in itself is a special character; 
                    preceding the decimal point with \ means the pattern must look for the literal character '.'), followed by any numeric character 
                    0 or more times (<code>\d</code> means numeric character, <code>*</code> means 0 or more times). In addition, parentheses are used to remember the first 
                    matched numeric characters.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    This pattern is found in "Open Chapter 4.3, paragraph 6" and '4' is remembered. The pattern is not found in "Chapter 3 and 4", because that 
                    string does not have a period after the '3'.   
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    To match a substring without causing the matched part to be remembered, within the parentheses preface the pattern with <code>?:</code>. For example, <code>(?:\d+)</code> 
                    matches one or more numeric characters but does not remember the matched characters.
                 </p>

            <header><h2 >Working with Regular Expressions</h2></header>
            <p>
                Regular expressions are used with the <code>RegExp</code> methods <code>test</code> and <code>exec</code> and with the <code>String</code> methods <code>match</code>, <code>replace</code>, <code>search</code>, 
                and <code>split</code>. These methods are explained in detail in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference">JavaScript reference</a>.  
            </p>
            <p>
                When you want to know whether a pattern is found in a string, use the <code>test</code> or <code>search</code> method; for more information (but slower execution) 
                use the <code>exec</code> or <code>match</code> methods. If you use <code>exec</code> or<code> match</code> and if the match succeeds, these methods return an array and update properties 
                of the associated regular expression object and also of the predefined regular expression object, <code>RegExp</code>. If the match fails, the <code>exec</code> method 
                returns <code>null</code> (which coerces to <code>false</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
                In the following example, the script uses the exec method to find a match in a string.
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        var myRe = /d(b+)d/g;
                        var myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not need to access the properties of the regular expression, an alternative way of creating myArray is with this script
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        var myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz'); 
                        // similar to "cdbbdbsbz".match(/d(b+)d/g); however,
                        // "cdbbdbsbz".match(/d(b+)d/g) outputs Array [ "dbbd" ], while 
                        // /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz') outputs Array [ 'dbbd', 'bb', index: 1, input: 'cdbbdbsbz' ].
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to construct the regular expression from a string, yet another alternative is this script:
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        var myRe = new RegExp('d(b+)d', 'g');
                        var myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                As shown in the second form of this example, you can use a regular expression created with an object initializer without 
                assigning it to a variable. If you do, however, every occurrence is a new regular expression. For this reason, if you use 
                this form without assigning it to a variable, you cannot subsequently access the properties of that regular expression. 
                For example, assume you have this script:
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        var myRe = /d(b+)d/g;
                        var myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
                        console.log('The value of lastIndex is ' + myRe.lastIndex);
                        
                        // "The value of lastIndex is 5"
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if you have this script:
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        var myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
                        console.log('The value of lastIndex is ' + /d(b+)d/g.lastIndex);
                        
                        // "The value of lastIndex is 0"   
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                The occurrences of <code>/d(b+)d/g</code> in the two statements are different regular expression objects and hence have 
                different values for their <code>lastIndex</code> property. If you need to access the properties of a regular expression 
                created with an object initializer, you should first assign it to a variable.    
            </p>
            <h3 id="Using_Parenthesized_Substring_Matches">Using Parenthesized Substring Matches</h3>
            <p>
                Including parentheses in a regular expression pattern causes the corresponding submatch to be 
                remembered. For example, <code>/a(b)c/</code> matches the characters 'abc' and remembers 'b'. To recall these 
                parenthesized substring matches, use the <code>Array</code> elements <code>[1]</code>, ..., <code>[n]</code>.    
            </p>
            <p>
                The number of possible parenthesized substrings is unlimited. The returned array holds all that were found. 
                The following examples illustrate how to use parenthesized substring matches.   
            </p>
            <p>
                The following script uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace">replace()</a> 
                method to switch the words in the string. For the replacement text, 
                the script uses the <code>$1</code> and <code>$2</code> in the replacement to denote the first and second parenthesized substring matches.   
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        var re = /(\w+)\s(\w+)/;
                        var str = 'John Smith';
                        var newstr = str.replace(re, '$2, $1');
                        console.log(newstr);
                        
                        // "Smith, John"     
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <h3 id="Advanced_Searching_With_Flags">Advanced Searching with Flags</h3>
            <p>
                Regular expressions have six optional flags that allow for functionality like global and case insensitive searching. 
                These flags can be used separately or together in any order, and are included as part of the regular expression.   
            </p>
            <p>
                To include a flag with the regular expression, use this syntax:
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        var re = /pattern/flags;
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                or
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        var re = new RegExp('pattern', 'flags');
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that the flags are an integral part of a regular expression. They cannot be added or removed later.    
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, <code>re = /\w+\s/g</code> creates a regular expression that looks for one or more characters followed 
                by a space, and it looks for this combination throughout the string.    
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        var re = /\w+\s/g;
                        var str = 'fee fi fo fum';
                        var myArray = str.match(re);
                        console.log(myArray);
                        
                        // ["fee ", "fi ", "fo "]    
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                You could replace the line:    
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        var re = /\w+\s/g;     
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                with:
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        var re = new RegExp('\\w+\\s', 'g');
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                and get the same result.
            </p>
            <p>
                The behavior associated with the <code>'g'</code> flag is different when the <code>.exec()</code> method is used.  
                (The roles of "class" and "argument" get reversed: In the case of <code>.match()</code>, the string 
                class (or data type) owns the method and the regular expression is just an argument, while 
                in the case of <code>.exec()</code>, it is the regular expression that owns the method, with the string 
                being the argument.  Contrast <code>str.match(re)</code> versus <code>re.exec(str)</code>.)  The '<code>g</code>' flag is used 
                with the <code>.exec()</code> method to get iterative progression.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>m</code> flag is used to specify that a multiline input string should be treated as multiple lines. If the m flag is used, 
                <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> match at the start or end of any line within the input string instead of the start or end of the entire string.
